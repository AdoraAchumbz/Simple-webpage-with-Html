    <h1>About Water</h1>
  
  <h2>Importance of Water</h2>
  <p>Water is essential for all forms of life. It makes up a significant portion of our body and is crucial for various bodily functions. Additionally, water plays a vital role in the environment, supporting ecosystems and providing habitats for many species.</p>
  
  <h2>Properties of Water</h2>
  <p>Water is a unique substance with several interesting properties:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Universal Solvent:</strong> Water can dissolve a wide range of substances, making it an excellent solvent for many chemical reactions.</li>
    <li><strong>High Specific Heat:</strong> Water has a high heat capacity, allowing it to absorb and retain heat without significant temperature changes.</li>
    <li><strong>Surface Tension:</strong> Water exhibits surface tension, causing it to form droplets and create capillary action.</li>
    <li><strong>Expansion Upon Freezing:</strong> Unlike most liquids, water expands when it freezes, which is why ice floats on water.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Water Conservation</h2>
  <p>Conserving water is crucial to ensure its availability for future generations. Here are some simple ways to conserve water:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Fix any leaks in your home.</li>
    <li>Take shorter showers.</li>
    <li>Turn off the tap while brushing your teeth.</li>
